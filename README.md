 YouTube Influencer Analysis â€“ Tableau Data Visualization Project

 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing YouTube influencer trends using Tableau. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to success on YouTube, including content categories, engagement metrics, and regional impacts. The insights from this analysis will help brands and advertisers make data-driven marketing decisions.

 Dataset  
- Name: "YouTube 100,000 Influencers" dataset  
- Source: Provided in the project  
- Contents: Data on popular YouTube channels, including categories, engagement rates, follower counts, and geographical information  
- Preprocessing Steps:  
  - Removed irrelevant/missing data  
  - Standardized column formats (e.g., follower counts, engagement rates)  
  - Structured data for visualization in Tableau  

 Key Analysis & Insights  

 1. Popular Content Categories  
- Certain content types (e.g., entertainment, gaming, vlogs) show significantly higher engagement.  
- Brands should focus on collaborating with influencers in these high-engagement categories.  

 2. Viewer Loyalty and Engagement  
- Channels with a longer presence on YouTube generally have higher follower retention.  
- However, newer channels focusing on short-form content (e.g., YouTube Shorts) are gaining traction quickly.  

 3. Content Localization & Audience Reach  
- Influencers in certain regions (e.g., North America and Asia) tend to have broader global audiences.  
- Localized content strategies help drive engagement in specific target markets.
